// Data types.
// there are 2 types of data types that
//  1 primitive and other is objects.
//  objects are written in the curly brackets.
// example
// let a = {
//     name:"John",
//     age:25,
//     city: "London",
// };

// any data type which is not objects are primitive type of data types.
// there are 7 types of primitive datatypes.
// 1 Number 
// 2 String
// 3 boolean
// 4 undefined
// 5 null
// 6 bigInt (Larger integers than the Number type can hold)
// 7 Symbol (not very important or useful for now. it was introduced in ES 2020)

//  Dynamic typing: Javascript support dynamic typing which means we do manually define the datatypes data types are determined automatically
// 1 Numbers are always decimal types.
    // example let a = 23; it is equal to 23.0
    
// 2 String is a sequence of charecters.
// 3. boolean is true or false

// there is a difference between value and variable that a variables do not have data types the values have 

//  Dynamic typing example let a =
// let fname = "Mark";
// console.log(fname);

// fname = 45.55;
// console.log(fname);

console.log(typeof(34));
